# ELEC5305 Project â€“ Real-Time Speech Dereverberation

**SID**: 530598444  
**Repo**: elec5305-project-530598444  

## Overview
This project builds a simple MATLAB program to reduce reverberation in recorded speech. It uses room impulse response (RIR) estimation with exponential sine sweep (ESS) and STFT-based filters (spectral subtraction / Wiener). The goal is to make speech clearer in everyday rooms.

## Methods
- Tools: MATLAB (main)
- Techniques: ESS, STFT/iSTFT, spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering  
- Data: self-recorded speech 

## Outputs
- Example spectrograms
- Audio samples
